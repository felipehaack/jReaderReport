##Introducting

How you know, there's a lot of projects that allow you show a newspaper, magazine or comic book edition for tablets, smartphones and desktop. Moreover, with effects to go to the next/previous page and features like video, sounds, animations within of the edition. Say this, I'm developing an API for you report critical information to the Google Analytics.

##What Can It Report?
First, I'll explain to you what's a title, issue, page and interactivity.

1. Title: It's a newspaper, magazine or comic book name. 
2. Issue: Within a title there's some edition, but, I named "issue".
3. Page: The pages from each edition.
4. Interactivity: The features like a video, sounds, etc, within page.
